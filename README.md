A small starter kit for test environments

## Getting Started Started


**Navigate to your `Sites` directory**

```
cd ~/Sites
```

**Clone this directory**
```
git clone git@github.com:NathanHass/CSS-Playground.git
```

**Navigate into the CSS Playground directory**
```
cd CSS-Playground
```

**Now it's time to build this thing out. First run a bower install**
```
bower install
```

**Next let's start watching for changes with a compass watch**
```
compass watch
```

**Finally let's get a simple server running**
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Bam, you did it! Now visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) and make a thing!
